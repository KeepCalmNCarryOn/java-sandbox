 * Examples of commonly seen exception -NoClassDefFoundError.
 * This exception occurs when the JVM can't find a class it needs because of a 
 * command-line error, a classpath issue or a missing .class file.
 * 
 * NOTE:  Too see the exception run from the commandline 
 * i.e. in eclipse: 
 * 			1.  compile using the jar file that contains the hello package
 * 			2.  cd to the folder containing NoClassDefFound.class
 * 			3.  attempt to run without the jar file i.e. 
 * 				 	from the directory above the package with the .class file in it
 * 					java -cp . common_exceptions.NoClassDefFound
 * 			4.  Note that the following will run successfully. 
 * 			    java -cp .:/absolute/path/to/HelloWorld.jar common_exceptions.NoClassDefFound
